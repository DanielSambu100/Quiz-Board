#QUIZ BOARD SYSTEM

####A school-based system for multiple choice questions, Version 1.2022.

####Author: Daniel Sambu.

#This is my third independent project (IP) on a user-centered school-based application for managing multiple choice questions. It aims towards showcasing my understanding of the JS progrmming language. It is designed for improving interactivity between the highschool management and the students in the dissemination of multiple choice questions. The building blocks forming up this application are HTML for the structure, vannila CSS for styling and Javascript for page dynamism and interactivity.

####Installation:

#This project is still under development, infact it's in its initial stages! More commits will be streaming in from time to time to realize its ultimate look and feel. Therefore, do not be surprised based on the first impression!

#The application is web-based, therefore its manipulation embraces web browsers, Chrome being the preference.
